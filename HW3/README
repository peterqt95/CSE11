This assignment tests our ability to manipulate strings as well as use loops.

Part 1 was a guessing game program that tested our understanding of loops.
With the use of a while loop and some conditional statements, I was able to 
complete this part of the assignment as well as compiling and running 
successfully.

Part 2 was a string parsing program that tested our ability to use loops and
manipulation of strings.  Using a while loop and some String class methods,
I was successfully able to compile and run this program as well as obtaining
the correct outputs.

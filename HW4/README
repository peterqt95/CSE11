The goal of this assignment was to test our ability to manipulate
integer arrays.

The only problem of this assignment was to create a sudoku solver using
our knowledge of loops, conditional statements, and array manipulation.
I was succesfully able to write and compile this part with correct outputs.
The program functions by reading in a .txt file containing a 9x9 unfinished
sudoku table and then proceeds to solve the puzzle by running through
a continuous loop that checks if there is only one possible value
at the location you are checking. If there is only one possible value then
assign that value to the location, if not skip it. The final product is 
a completed printed sudoku table.

To run this program you must read in a .txt file that contains a 9x9
table that contains numbers from 0 through 9 in each location.
Example:
$ emacs table1.txt
7 6 9 0 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0
8 0 0 0 3 0 0 7 6
0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2
0 0 5 4 1 8 7 0 0
4 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
6 1 0 0 9 0 0 0 8
0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0 0 1 5 4
$ java Sudoku table1.txt
7 9 6 8 5 4 3 2 1
2 4 3 1 7 6 9 8 5
8 5 1 2 3 9 4 7 6
1 3 7 9 6 5 8 4 2
9 2 5 4 1 8 7 6 3
4 6 8 7 2 3 5 1 9
6 1 4 5 9 7 2 3 8
5 8 2 3 4 1 6 9 7
3 7 9 6 8 2 1 5 4

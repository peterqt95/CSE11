This assignment tests our ability to manipulate arrays, implement methods, and use
of file input streams.

Part 1 of the assignment was to create a program similair to Scrabble which 
tested our implementation of methods and array manipulation. The program checks
whether or not the inputed word can be created from the characters given to you
by checking the .txt file given to you and adds up points that are made up of the 
total valid word length entered. Menu options 2 and 3 are available in this part 
where option 2 gives you a brand new set of letters to work with and option 3 exits 
the game. I was able to successfully complete, compile and run this part of the 
assignment.

Part 2 of the assignment checks the array of characters you have and trys to find
the longest word possible made from those characters.  The maximum length returned
can be of length 6 and minimum length 1. It cycles through the .txt file given to us 
and pulls out all the words with length 6 and sees if it can be constructed from 
the letters that we have. If there is no valid word, we cycle through the dictionary
again but checking the next largest possible word length which would be 5. The program
continues to cycle through the dicitonary until a valid word is found and will always
return at least a word of length 1. I was able to successfully complete, compile and
run this part of the assignment.

USAGE NOTES:
The .txt file used must have the first line of the file must be an integer value that
indicates the amount of words in the .txt file. Each word must individually be on its
own line so that it can be inputted into a String array.

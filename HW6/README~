This assignment tests our ability to manipulate classes and inheritance as well as writing
into files and using javascript to graph our data.

Part 1 of the assignment had us create a CSV parser which read in a CSV formatted document
and stored each line of the file into a String array where each value separated by the commas
were unique. This utilized our knowledge of ArrayLists and fileinput. I was able to successfully 
compile and run this program and yielded the correct outputs.

USAGE NOTES FOR PART 1:
The CSV file must be in the format:
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adj Close
12/4/2014,531.16,537.34,528.59,537.31,1388300,537.31
where each line and its values are separated by a comma.
